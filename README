# bytebuffer

Library for packing and unpacking binary data. Simplifies working
with java.nio.ByteBuffer objects.

Handles signed and unsigned values pleasantly. Usually reading or
writing unsigned fields with ByteBuffers is a pain because Java
doesn't have unsigned primitives. The unsigned take-* functions here
actually return a type that is one step larger than the requested
type, ex. take-ushort returns an int, and take-uint returns a
bigint. 

## Usage

Provides pack and unpack functions inspired by Python's struct
module. Use simple format strings, similar to printf's, to define how
fields are layed out in the buffer.

    (pack buff \"isbb\" 123 43 23 3) ; puts an int, a short and two bytes into buff
    (.flip buff) ; assuming nothing else was written to the buffer
    (unpack buff \"isbb\") => (123 43 24 3)

Provides pack-bits and unpack-bits functions for working with bit
fields within numbers.

    (pack-bits 2 3 2 true 3 false 1 1) => 2r11010001

    (unpack-bits 2r101011001 4 \b 1 1 2) => (10 true 1 0 1)
